This project uses dataset from kaggle published by professor Clayton: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claytonmiller/construction-and-project-management-example-data

There are 2 major steps in the projects:
1. Use Python to explore and transform the data.
   - The major transformation is the time conversions into different scale as I first didn't know if the duration is just a few seconds, or years.
   - There are multiple types of data while I only filtered for Safety form in the end, as I found there's very little consistancy of data within different type.
   
2. Create dashboard
   - You can view dashboard on https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tiffany4587/viz/ConstructionManagement-SafetyForm/Dashboard1
